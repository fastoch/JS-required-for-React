# Arrow Functions

When working with React, we use a lot of arrow functions.  
- Classic function syntax:
```js
function DoSomething() {
  // the logic goes here 
}
```
- Arrow function:
```js
const DoSomething = () => {
  // the logic goes here 
}
```

In React, we define components, and components are just functions.  
```js
const MyComponent = () => {
 
}
```
