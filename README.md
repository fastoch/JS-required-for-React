# Arrow Functions

When working with React, we use a lot of arrow functions.  
- Classic function syntax:
```js
function DoSomething() {
  // the logic goes here 
}
```
- Arrow function:
```js
const DoSomething = () => {
  // the logic goes here 
}
```

In React, we define components, and components are just functions.  
```js
const MyComponent = (props) => {
  // some hooks
  // some helper functions
  // a return statement containing our JSX 
}
```

## Anonymous functions

They allow us to execute a piece of logic without having to declare a function:
```jsx
<button>
  onClick={() => { some logic }}
</button>
```
